Ribbans has offered surgical or medical care to Olympic and world champions \u2013 from", "Greg Rutherford", "and Paula Radcliffe to Michael Schumacher and Jessica Ennis-Hill \u2013 while also working for the British Boxing Board of Control, Northampton Saints, Northamptonshire cricket club and England\u2019s rugby union team.", "At his clinic in Northampton, Ribbans is calm and eloquent whether detailing urgent issues of player welfare in rugby or describing the ethical issues a doctor encounters in professional sport as they come under pressure from managers and coaches in an increasingly litigious world. Ribbans works for the NHS, and at his own private practice, and it is striking he should have done so much in sport for free.", "\u201cI used to get 25 quid for working ringside at a boxing promotion but this is the first year I\u2019ve received a stipend for working in sport, and it\u2019s from Northamptonshire cricket,\u201d he reveals with a wry smile. It has offered him an independence which means he can temper his innate love of sport with a critical eye. Ribbans has now", "written a book", "which provides \u201ca surgeon\u2019s perspective from the sharp end of sport\u201d. It is a vast and detailed work which also tracks the way that sport has changed.", "\u201cIn 1997,\u201d Ribbans recalls, \u201cthe Bath Rugby doctor said: \u2018Last year I was the only professional in an amateur sport and now I\u2019m the only amateur in a professional sport.\u2019 Sport has changed dramatically. Obviously, by turning professional, players make a good living and it increases their potential for earnings after rugby. No one wants to deny them that. But we need to get the balance right between performance and player welfare. All medics need that quiet confidence to stand up to the pressures that come from the manager, the agent and parents. Without it, you can lose your moral compass.\u201d", "Rugby is Ribbans\u2019s favourite sport and, as a doctor, he helped Northampton win the Premiership and the Heineken Cup and he has worked alongside coaches including Ian McGeechan, Wayne Smith and Clive Woodward. But his passion for rugby does not deter him from making a startling statement: \u201cIt could be argued that the game turning professional in 1996 was the worst thing that could have happened in terms of player welfare.\u201d", "Ribbans played at county level as a schoolboy and he argues that, \u201crugby, pre-1995, always had potential dangers. But back then everybody had to go to work on a Monday morning and they could only train a couple of nights a week. That held the physicality of the game in check. Once it went professional people could spend six days a week training, be in the gym, take advantage of nutrition and sports science. They turned into enormous players.\u201d", "In rugby, pre-1995, players could only train a couple of nights a week. That held the physicality of the game in check", "The ensuing collisions have become so dangerous that players", "are in constant jeopardy", ". Ribbans believes changes in the way the tackle laws are interpreted have intensified the hazards. \u201cWhen we played, as soon as your knee hit the ground you had to release the ball. That\u2019s why we took people round the legs. But modern players can roll away and recycle the ball. The opposition has to try and monster people by taking them higher to gain control of the ball. It increases the regularity of double-teaming which really worries me. The first player pins the attacker and the second tackler hits him. It can lead to really nasty injuries.\u201d", "As a rugby fan Ribbans travelled to South Africa to support the Lions in 2009. The second Test in 2009 was the most brutal match", "he had ever seen", ". \u201cWhen five of your 22 are detained in hospital overnight, you think: \u2018Is this really where the sport should be heading?\u2019 James Robson [the former Lions team doctor] made those comments that the balance had gone wrong. He\u2019s highly respected and he said: \u2018Rugby\u2019s reached a tipping point.\u2019 But it hadn\u2019t.\u201d", "Eleven years later professional rugby players are even bigger, faster and more capable of inflicting permanent ruin on their opponents and themselves. Does rugby need protecting from itself? \u201cIn 2018 there were four deaths in French rugby, and three more in Canada, South Africa and Samoa. Head injuries, broken necks and heart attacks were to blame. It was terrible but I hope 2018 was the tipping point. There are some very committed doctors who World Rugby now listen to. But the lawyers might be the biggest catalyst for change.\u201d", "Rugby\u2019s unsustainable workload for their leading players has spread to other sports \u2013 particularly during the pandemic. \u201cIn rugby, players like Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje face a 51-week season leading to that final Test in Johannesburg between the Lions and Springboks [next August]. It\u2019s too much. Other sports are the same. Look at footballers. After the Euros next year we know the injury toll will be high when they come back in autumn. Then they\u2019re going to be going to the World Cup qualifiers, and they\u2019re bringing the Qatar World Cup forward. It\u2019s going to end some players\u2019 careers much earlier.", "\u201cThe damage is obvious. More and more you\u2019re having conversations with players", "who have arthritis", ". Over my career you\u2019d see ex-players having their hip and knee replacements in their 50s and 60s. They are now in their 40s or 30s. I\u2019ve got a lad I\u2019ve looked after since he was a teenager. He\u2019s in his 30s and he\u2019s facing a shoulder replacement and his knee is not far behind.\u201d", "In his book Ribbans is scathing of leading football coaches who try to coerce their medical staff into putting performance ahead of player welfare. He also remembers how, when Northampton were relegated from the Premiership in 2007, the rugby players he had cared for complained he had not resorted to surgery often enough. \u201cI said: \u2018If I had a reputation for being Butcher Bill, I\u2019d be very worried. I will do everything I can not to operate to get you better.\u2019\u201d", "Boxing", "is different. \u201cPeople in [the sport] have always been very respectful of medical views. If you did a medical check on a boxer and said \u2018I don\u2019t think they should fight\u2019, your view was always accepted. Even the promoter who stood to lose money and the boxer who had trained so hard were always guided by the doctor. I\u2019ve not seen that repeated to the same degree in other sports.\u201d", "Boxing presented Ribbans with his first foray into elite sport in 1981 \u2013 and he was exposed to some wild nights. \u201cOne evening [in the 1980s] I worked on a promotion at the Cafe Royal. It was one of those strange affairs where dinner is served while the boxing is on and everyone, including me, has to wear black tie. Normally you had two doctors present. One doctor sees the boxers in the dressing room while the other is ringside. That night I realised the other doctor was not coming. It was pre-mobile [phone] days so we couldn\u2019t track him down.", "\u201cThe question was do we cancel the whole evening with all the diners there? I agreed with the promoter and the board of control that we would slow everything down. That would allow me to see the boxers after a fight, make sure they\u2019re OK, and then we\u2019d start the next one when I was ringside. But four of the boxers needed suturing, so the crowd were getting restless, slow-handclapping because they wanted me to stitch faster. I got blood all down the front of me and missed the dinner.\u201d", "Ribbans smiles at the memory \u2013 as he does when remembering his contrasting experience at the peak of Formula One. In 1999, while trying to win a first drivers\u2019 world championship for Ferrari,", "Michael Schumacher", "crashed into a Silverstone wall after his brakes failed at 191mph. He had broken a tibia and fibula and Ribbans knew he needed an urgent operation. However, Jean Todt, Ferrari\u2019s team principal at the time, wanted Schumacher to be flown to Paris for surgery. \u201cMichael was very calm,\u201d Ribbans says, \u201cespecially as there was this maelstrom around him.", "\u201cJean Todt poked me in the chest. I\u2019ve no idea how he even got into the operating theatre. He said: \u2018I\u2019m paying Schumacher $16m to drive for Ferrari. For me to allow Michael to have an operation in your hospital is a big responsibility. But it\u2019s an even bigger responsibility for you.\u2019 The hospital chief executive was behind me. He was very pale and said: \u2018You will bankrupt the hospital if this goes wrong\u2019 \u2013 because Schumacher was an NHS patient.", "\u201cIt was a nasty tibia fracture but one we see regularly. There were good medical reasons not to put Schumacher in an aeroplane to Paris but I also thought: \u2018If British orthopaedics, in the form of me, can\u2019t sort this out then that\u2019s not a very good advert for our surgeons.\u2019 I was really pleased we managed to do it straight away. I was home by seven that evening and it was done and dusted.\u201d", "The operation was a total success and Schumacher was delighted, inviting Ribbans and his wife to the following year\u2019s British Grand Prix", "Our Covid-world is darker now so does Ribbans feel pessimistic about the future of sport? \u201cI do. Football and rugby clubs face the possibility of no crowds all season. That was their lifeline. I suspect they will hold on to their marquee players but the cuts will come at academy level and with support staff. That worries me.\u201d", "The decision to go into lockdown and avoid mass gatherings remains crucial. \u201cAbsolutely. As a civilised society we can\u2019t have people dying in corridors, breathless, which is what we face if we don\u2019t get this crisis under control. I wasn\u2019t allowed to operate between March and July, which was difficult. I\u2019ve been operating for a long time but we all worry about deskilling.\u201d", "Ribbans can claim a 99% success rate with the 600-700 procedures he carries out in a normal year. \u201cI\u2019m just beginning to wind down now so I have done less lately. But you linger over the failures more. I thought it would get easier as you get older and you\u2019d be able to rationalise it. But I have sleepless nights about patients. You just want to do your best for them. I\u2019m 66 this month, we\u2019ve four grandchildren to look after, and I\u2019m going to stop operating next March. I\u2019ll still work as a sports doctor but I\u2019m going to lay the scalpel down.\u201d", "He will continue being the doctor for Northamptonshire cricket team, but will he miss surgery? \u201cI will. It\u2019s what defines us. We curse when the phone goes on a Sunday morning because somebody is injured. But, equally, it\u2019s nice to feel that people trust you and want you to help them.\u201d", "Knife in the Fast Lane by Bill Ribbans is published by Pitch"]},

In this sense, social media is simply an extension of Mourinho\u2019s footballing persona: one that wickedly skirts the boundaries of the real and the artificial, the text and the subtext. \u201cMy dog died, and I\u2019m fucked,\u201d he announces in last season\u2019s All or Nothing documentary, to general bewilderment.

Modern coaching, exemplified not just by your Klopps and your Guardiolas but by your Potters and your Hasenh\u00fcttls, worships the process: clear ideals, a finely-miniaturised system, a tolerance of individual error.

They have a simple and unfussy game based on shape, percentages and rapid counterattacks. Perhaps this is the best way to negotiate the Covid era: football chiselled and honed and sanded down to a fine point.", "Above all they have Mourinho, who quite apart from convincing Daniel Levy to open his chequebook during a pandemic feels uniquely suited to these straitened and sinister circumstances. J\u00fcrgen Klopp looks tired. Pep Guardiola looks tired. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r looks glassy-eyed and a little ill, like a man addicted to cod liver oil. Mourinho, on the other hand, was born tired; indeed has made a virtue of his tiredness. This is a man, remember, who spent literally his entire Manchester United reign eating via room service. This season has already served up 15 games in two months. And so he simply pops up his hood, furrows his brow and steels himself for another day of trampling on dreams.", "Diego Torres\u2019s biography of Mourinho famously outlined his manifesto of reactive football, defined by apparent blasphemies like \u201cthe game is won by the team committing fewer errors\u201d and \u201cwhoever has the ball has fear\u201d. Yet read it back now and what strikes you is not how outdated it seems, but how relevant to the current climate. In a time of fear, when everyone is vulnerable, when everyone is making mistakes, Mourinho will be the last man standing, grinding you down and plundering the spoils: the looter in a world of broken windows. And ultimately, it feels churlish to dissent too strongly to any of this.", "Football has never simply been an exercise in maxim and dogma, but a game of wits and adaptation. And if for the last few years English football has belonged to the ideologues and the perfectionists, perhaps its next chapter will belong to the dissemblers and the pragmatists: a game of fake crowd noise and concentration lapses and \u00a314.95 pay-per-view fixtures. Perhaps, improbably, this is Mourinho\u2019s true calling: a soiled man for a soiled game."]},

Martin Slumbers, Dawson\u2019s successor, finds himself in the impossible position of regularly having to tiptoe around the issues attached to that scenario, but the subtext has been abundantly clear. Hosting their marquee event, with the world looking on, at a course owned by the \u2013 insert adjective \u2013 president of the USA constitutes a practical and political nightmare for the R&A.", "There has never been any chance of it happening. Slumbers has branded the situation a \u201ccomplex\u201d one. \u201cTurnberry is a fantastic golf course and will be a great venue when we get there,\u201d added the chief executive. He might as well have been anticipating the first hole-in-one on Pluto.", "The R&A responded with surprise to a summer report \u2013 rigorously denied \u2013 that stated Trump had nudged the American ambassador to Britain about helping return the Open to Turnberry. Whatever the nature of the supposed request, it didn\u2019t seem to reach R&A headquarters. That Trump would cherish an Open was known long before he took the presidency. It may also partly explain the business rationale of his involvement with a resort which has gone through multiple foreign owners.", "There are background problems with Turnberry. Low attendance figures, due to its geographical remoteness, work against the Ayrshire course in an era where the R&A is fixated with ticket sales. Royal Lytham & St Annes and Muirfield appear on the naughty step under the same, depressingly corporate rationale.

Thirty-two years on, Tom Watson came within one horribly jabbed putt", "of delivering a true sporting fairy", "tale", ". But for a Covid-triggered delay, the championship would already have visited Royal St George\u2019s twice as Turnberry looks on enviously from the sidelines.", "If forensic background reports were produced regarding the ownership or membership of umpteen championship golf sites, the picture would be far from endearing. History tells us that while onlookers initially recoil in horror at the choosing of certain sites, noise dissipates as players beat a merry path towards pound signs and prizes.

Until, perhaps, the man in question is no longer president. At that stage, does golfing officialdom edge itself back towards another golf course owner who holds controversial viewpoints?

How many senior men\u2019s players would regard playing under adapted rules \u2013 with barely any scrums and games cut to 70 minutes \u2013 as ideal preparation for a major Test?", "As a perfect story, winning a World Cup in New Zealand would be pretty much top of the list", "Few, certainly, would be good enough to switch from 15s to sevens - Scarratt competed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio \u2013 and back without breaking stride. If anything, she looks to be playing as well as ever. \u201cI play rugby because I love it. Everyone says that, don\u2019t they? But for me it\u2019s the truth. I wouldn\u2019t still be able to keep doing if it was starting to feel like a task. That\u2019s certainly not the case at the moment.\u201d", "It certainly sounded fun after the grand slam was secured at a deserted stadium in Parma. The players were not even allowed to shower afterwards before being whisked back to their hotel but their post-match spirits remained undimmed. \u201cIt was a bit strange but it was also oddly nice. Normally you\u2019ve got lots of friends and family there but in this case no one had anywhere to drift to. We could only celebrate with each other so we put on some cheesy songs that everyone was singing and dancing to. There was a bit of Whitney [Houston], obviously. Hang on, that\u2019s doing her a disservice. She\u2019s not cheesy at all.\u201d", "Those who argue that England, with the advantage of full-time contracts, could do with stiffer competition are also forgetting the self-imposed pressure that top players like Scarratt place on themselves. \u201cYou go through waves in your career. When you burst on to the scene as a youngster, almost anything you do is good because expectations are really low. Then, all of a sudden, expectation rockets.", "\u201cPeople expect you to do those things all the time. When you get a bit older and wiser it\u2019s about releasing that pressure from yourself. It\u2019s still there but it\u2019s about doing the things you know you\u2019re capable of. It\u2019s also easy to do your job reasonably well when you\u2019ve got world-class players all around you.\u201d", "Beneath the modesty, though, remains a layer of steely ambition. Scarratt may be a 2014 World Cup winner and the reigning World Rugby women\u2019s player of the year, having been lauded alongside South Africa\u2019s Pieter Steph du Toit in Japan a year ago, but the qualified teacher is not yet entirely fulfilled.", "\u201cIf you were to write anything down as a perfect story, winning a World Cup in New Zealand would be pretty much top of the list. It\u2019s a huge year for us \u2026 we\u2019re going to have to be adaptable along the way but we all know the prize we want. It\u2019s not going to be a smooth ride but it\u2019s really exciting.\u201d", "The only other thing left is for the general public to appreciate fully the quality of Scarratt, Sarah Hunter, Katy Daley-McLean, Sarah Bern, Jess Breach and the rest of this super-impressive England squad. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve played at Twickenham after the men you get an extended crowd who, in many cases, have never seen women\u2019s rugby before. Even if they\u2019re just waiting for the traffic to die down you\u2019ll get people afterwards saying: \u2018I really enjoyed it, it\u2019s better than the men\u2019s.\u2019 It\u2019s a case of continuing to make people aware that if you enjoy rugby then, in theory, you should enjoy women\u2019s rugby.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve taken such huge strides in the sport. There are so, so many positive stories of girls and women, from five years old to 40 years old, who have taken up rugby. Without wishing to sound too dramatic, it has changed people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s the thing we need to be spreading, not the other stuff that appears on social media. We have an excellent platform at the moment to show what a great sport it is. Hopefully lots of people will get on board with that.\u201d"]},

One team might want to play a particular fixture at a particular ground on a particular date, to coincide with unrelated celebrations \u2013 Kent, for example, liked to play Sussex at the Nevill Ground, which during the early part of the 20th century was not just close to the county border but actually upon it, during Tunbridge Wells week.

In the early years Yorkshire and Lancashire always played each other on Whitsun weekend, but then when fixtures for 1896 were being arranged Yorkshire quietly requested to play the touring Australians instead.", "When Lancashire got wind of this, they asked to play Australia as well and publicly denounced their rivals.

Different counties took different views on whether to move major matches to the new date or keep them in early summer but that game stayed where it was to avoid a clash with football. In 1966 a ballot system had been introduced to decide who would get to play the touring sides on bank holiday weekends, from which some counties opted out.", "Then there were all the basic rules of county fixture-compilation: Middlesex could not play at home on the same day as Surrey, for example, and Test grounds had to see no action for at least three days before a Test match.

In a world of walls and bubbles, the very concept of international cricket is being imperilled before our eyes.

Kieron Pollard, who\u2019s second, has 694, Brendon McCullum, third, has 485. If you take all the sixes MS Dhoni has hit in his career and add them together with all the sixes Virat Kohli has hit in his career and then throw in all the sixes Yuvraj Singh has hit in his career, you still don\u2019t come close to Gayle\u2019s total in T20s.", "Gayle has scored more runs in sixes alone than the vast majority of players make any way in their entire T20 careers. Really. There are only 36 other batsmen who\u2019ve made more than 6,000 T20 runs. Gayle is so far ahead that you have to start measuring him against entire countries. He hasn\u2019t just hit more sixes than any player, he\u2019s hit more sixes than any international team, more than Australia have managed in 968 international T20 innings, more than all the 152 players who\u2019ve taken strike for Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have between the lot of them in 15 years of international T20 cricket.", "He\u2019s a one-man superpower, the Jeff Bezos of boundary hitting. He\u2019s hit sixes for 26 teams in 13 different leagues across eight different countries and five continents, has broken the records for most sixes in the Indian Premier League, the Caribbean Premier League, and the Bangladesh Premier League. So long as Gayle\u2019s playing, it\u2019s always six o\u2019clock somewhere in the world.", "Given that Gayle also holds the record for hitting the most sixes in all forms of international cricket (534 in Test matches, one-day matches, and T20s for the West Indies), it\u2019s just possible that he\u2019s hit more sixes than anyone else in the history of the game, that he is, in fact, the sixiest cricketer who ever lived. Since we don\u2019t have records for first class and List A cricket, it\u2019s impossible to say for sure. But T20 has been played in an era when each and every ball\u2019s recorded, which means that we can list all of Gayle\u2019s sixes, from the very first, a lofted on-drive off George O\u2019Brien for Jamaica against Bermuda in the Stanford 20/20 in 2006, to his 1,001st, a swat over the leg-side off a full toss from the ball before Archer got him out last Friday.", "My favourites were the three he took off Brett Lee at the Oval during the World T20 back in 2009, one pulled out of the ground and over the road into the Archbishop Tenison\u2019s school, another on to the top of the Bedser Stand, a third into the stands at midwicket. Lee got him in the end, for 88 off 50 balls, but his four overs cost 56 runs, and West Indies won by seven wickets. They were shots that shook the game. It was one of those moments when the sport seemed to take a sudden leap forward in the space of a single, short spell of play, a breathtakingly exciting contest between one of the world\u2019s best, and fastest, bowlers, and its most destructive batsmen. Those six deliveries gave a glimpse of the unimagined potential of the format.", "That was more than a decade ago now, ancient lore in a game that moves on so quickly. Gayle is 41 now, and has grey streaks in his beard. He\u2019s a liability in the field, and sometimes he even seems like a burden on his batting partners because he turns down so many singles. But, whatever else they tell you, there\u2019s enough of the old magic there. Kings XI were bottom of the table this season, till they brought him in to bat at No 3, then they won five in a row.", "Still, he\u2019s at the point where he\u2019s fending off questions about his retirement plans. And his fans hang on his tweets, wondering if they ought to read more into them than is really there. Just this week there was a flurry of stories asking whether he was going to quit because he sent one telling people to keep watching the IPL \u201c", "even though my season has come to an end", "\u201d. However he finishes, it surely won\u2019t be anything like so prosaic as that."]},

It was a nightmare,\u201d Boswell recalled. \u201cHow can I not be able to run up and bowl \u2013 something that I\u2019ve done for so many years without even thinking about it? How can that happen?

At 10pm the night before the final, Leicestershire\u2019s coach said he wanted to see him. He asked Boswell \u201cwhether I was up for it, and whether I could manage. So there was a seed put in my head before I actually played.\u201d He was finally told he was playing 45 minutes before the game. Somerset, Leicestershire\u2019s opponents, won the toss and chose to bat on a sunny day. Boswell, as one of the opening bowlers, bowled the second over.", "\u201cThe first couple of balls, I felt OK,\u201d he recalled. But on his last ball of the over, Boswell bowled an easy-to-hit short ball that was hit for four runs. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t come out of the hands right \u2026 It just became a little bit stuck.\u201d It signalled trouble ahead. The next over began with a huge wide. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh, Jesus Christ. I\u2019ve never bowled it that wide before \u2013 what\u2019s happened there?\u2019 And that was it. I then bowled another wide, the crowd started to make a bit of noise, I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Crikey.\u2019 It went down the leg side, so I\u2019ve got one on the offside, one on the leg side, I\u2019ve overcompensated and I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d", "An over in cricket comprises six balls \u2013 that is, six balls that are not considered a no-ball or wide.

As the pressure in a match rises, so can an athlete\u2019s anxiety.", "Anxiety is a reaction to pressure or stress. It tends to arise during performances that trigger the fear of losing, or fear of damage to your standing. The symptoms of anxiety are psychological \u2013 worry and fear \u2013 and physiological \u2013 including sweaty palms and an increased heart rate. Anxiety uses up attention and working memory, hindering performance.", "Athletes find themselves thinking about processes that normally come automatically. This was Boswell\u2019s experience. The simple act of bowling a ball, on which his career had been built, suddenly seemed alien. \u201cWhen your conscious mind doesn\u2019t trust your subconscious mind, you\u2019ve got an issue,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the flow and you\u2019re not thinking about it, you just bowl and you just trust your skills.\u201d Of that day at Lord\u2019s, Boswell said: \u201cI just didn\u2019t trust myself. I didn\u2019t trust my action and I didn\u2019t trust my skill set, and then when it was put under high pressure, it failed.\u201d", "When athletes are anxious, they overthink, and focus attention on the technical execution of the skill \u2013 those aspects of the movement that have generally become automated. It has been called \u201cparalysis by analysis\u201d: the mental effort actually inhibits performance. This explains why Boswell, a 26-year-old in his seventh season as a professional cricketer, suddenly found himself unable to bowl straight.", "As his second over became more farcical \u2013 six of his first eight balls were wides \u2013 Boswell recalled the crowd getting \u201clouder and louder\u201d. To try to make the ordeal stop, Boswell rushed, taking less and less time before each ball. \u201cI just remember trying to race through my over to get it completed as quickly as I could. Unfortunately, I sped things up when pressure got to me, rather than trying to slow it down and take a step back, do the breathing, have a little smile \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s only a game of cricket, off you go.\u2019\u201d", "Boswell blames no one but himself, but it might have helped if his teammates had gone up to him and had a chat to help him calm down during his over. At Lord\u2019s, the real problem was that Boswell\u2019s method \u2013 bowling and self-calming \u2013 was not durable enough under pressure. \u201cI probably didn\u2019t have a process if something ever happened. It was just absolute panic.\u201d Boswell only ever played one more game in professional cricket, bowling one terrible over \u2013 including two wides \u2013 before being dropped from the lineup.", "E", "lite athletes are like the rest of us: they get anxious and it hampers their performance. In the last 30 seconds of tight basketball games,", "WNBA", "and NBA players are 5.8% and 3.1% respectively less likely to score from a free throw \u2013 an uncontested shot awarded to players who have been fouled \u2013 than at other moments in the game. When players take free throws in home matches, they are more likely to miss when the crowd is bigger.", "The very best athletes manage to channel the anxiety they feel positively, especially if they have high self-confidence. Athletes with low confidence view anxiety as detrimental to performance, but those with high confidence tend to perceive anxiety as a sign of being ready for the challenge ahead. This makes them less likely to choke under pressure.", "The best athletes are also more adept at brushing off disappointments during competition.

It\u2019s just \u2013 how do you regain composure?\u201d", "Those with the greatest mental strength have been shown to be the best at adapting to negative feedback and using it to improve their performance. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to learn how to throw bad shots out and stand over the next shot and say: \u2018OK this is the most important shot,\u2019\u201d S\u00f6renstam said. \u201cI always call it \u2018the now shot\u2019.

There\u2019s nothing worse than when you try to do something and it\u2019s all tension and pressure and you can\u2019t breathe properly.\u201d", "The best golfers make greater use of positive self-talk, goal-setting and relaxation skills, reporting less worry and less negative thinking. Personality characteristics such as hardiness and even narcissism can further insulate the best athletes from the ravages of anxiety.", "\u201cOf course I felt pressure,\u201d S\u00f6renstam, now retired, recalled. \u201cBut it was a fun pressure \u2013 I wanted to see if I could handle it, just staying true to myself and believing in myself coming down the stretch.\u201d", "For S\u00f6renstam, keeping that belief over 18 holes meant sticking to her routine \u2013 the 24 seconds she liked to take for each shot \u2013 as far as possible, fighting her impulse to speed up. Under pressure, golfers approach shots differently, reducing the range of movement for the head of the golf club and applying greater force to the ball. They rush. In baseball, pitchers who flounder under pressure seem to rush their foot movements and speed up the way they flex their elbows.", "Athletes weighed down by anxiety also use their eyes less efficiently. When table tennis players are anxious, they spend longer fixating on the ball and less time on their opponent, which may reduce their ability to pick up cues and anticipate what will happen next. When tennis players are anxious, they become less effective at picking up contextual information such as the sequencing of shots in the rally and the probability of their opponent playing certain types of shots. Other anxiety-induced responses include hypervigilance \u2013 the \u201cdeer in the headlights\u201d phenomenon \u2013 a narrowed field of view or tunnel vision, or paying attention to irrelevant sights. In each of these cases, anxious athletes are likely to miss critical information.", "When they rush, athletes tend to make worse decisions. Maintaining routines under pressure can help prevent such errors. \u201cThat\u2019s the key \u2013 whether it\u2019s the first green or the 18th green on a Sunday at the US Open or a Pro Am, I just stick to the same routine,\u201d S\u00f6renstam said. \u201cBy doing that, you can deal with the pressure. People think: \u2018People are watching, this putt means this.\u2019 Or \u2018This is a tough hole\u2019, or \u2018It\u2019s an easy hole and I really should make it.\u2019 All these things around you have an effect on how you feel and how you perform.

Facing the bowler was Lance Klusener, who was in the midst of a stunning run of form. In the first two balls of the final over, Klusener crunched both deliveries for four.", "South Africa needed one run from four balls \u2013 with Klusener still facing the ball. At the other end, Allan Donald, South Africa\u2019s No 11 \u2013 a brilliant fast bowler, but the team\u2019s worst batsman \u2013 didn\u2019t need to face a ball.

In South Africa\u2019s changing room, one player had a bottle of champagne at hand, ready to pop.", "This was \u201cnearly job done\u201d, Klusener recalled. \u201cI said to Al that the first thing we would like to do is hit the ball for six, shake hands and walk off, but at the same time, if we can scramble a single run somewhere, that also needs to be an option for us. \u2018One good ball and the game is over.\u2019\u201d", "After a protracted wait, the bowler delivered his third ball. Klusener hit the ball straight towards a fielder. There was no time for the batsmen to run, yet Donald set off down the pitch. Klusener quickly sent him back, and Donald had to dive across the crease to get home. He was only saved because the Australian fielder\u2019s throw missed its target.", "Donald later described the moment in his autobiography. \u201cSprawled on the floor, heart pounding, I thought: \u2018Thank God, we\u2019ve got away with it.

By the time Klusener hared past him, all Donald had managed to do was drop his bat and look around forlornly. His legs wouldn\u2019t move. \u201cI looked up at Lance, saw him rushing to my end, and so I started to run,\u201d Donald wrote. \u201cMy legs felt like jelly, as if I wasn\u2019t making any headway at all down to the other end. I tried to get my legs moving properly. It was a dreamlike sequence, almost in slow motion.\u201d", "Donald was paralysed by anxiety \u2013 a classic symptom of choking.

When the scientists told the women that women performed just as well as men, they subsequently performed as well as the men on the test.

Rushing penalties under pressure damages the chances of scoring: a study found that when players started their run-up less than one second after the referee blew the whistle, the success rate was a paltry 58%.

They produced this in the most exacting circumstances: immediately after conceding an equaliser against massively favoured European giants, in their country\u2019s first World Cup finals fixture. \u201cWe were,\u201d the goalscorer, Lakhdar Belloumi, later said, \u201cthe Brazilians of Africa.\u201d And for at least half a minute in Gij\u00f3n, the world saw it.", "The team had made their name two years previously, when having qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time since the 1960s they made it to the final before losing against the hosts, Nigeria. After that match Helenio Herrera, then the Barcelona coach, sought out Belloumi, their young star, to discuss a potential transfer, which was stymied by the fact that until 1984 Algerian players were legally obliged to remain in their domestic league until the age of 27.", "The dawn of the 80s ushered in a decade-and-a-bit of Algerian success. In 20 attempts outside this period they have only once reached the Cup of Nations, but in 11 years starting in 1980 they finished fourth once, third twice, second once and eventually, in 1990, became champions. Also in 1980 they reached the quarter-finals of the Olympic Games in Moscow. None of this had made much of an impression in Europe, with the Guardian briskly dismissing them in our guide to the 1982", "World Cup", ". \u201cAlgeria are novices in international football,\u201d we wrote. \u201cThey rely on mercenaries from the French league and they will not bother the favourites.\u201d Of West Germany we asserted with certainty that \u201cthe Germans will progress into the second stage without any difficulty\u201d.", "The German team were if anything more confident still, though they had limited knowledge of their opponents. \u201cMy players would laugh their heads off if I showed them film of the Algerian team,\u201d said their coach, Jupp Derwall. \u201cIf we don\u2019t beat them, I\u2019ll be on the next train home.\u201d One of the German players predicted a rout: \u201cWe will dedicate our seventh goal to our wives,\u201d he said, \u201cand the eighth to our dogs.\u201d", "Toni Schumacher, their goalkeeper, said: \u201cWe really didn\u2019t take Algeria seriously. Back then we were really a footballing power, and then along comes this team we\u2019d never heard of. Algeria hadn\u2019t even qualified for a World Cup before. We certainly didn\u2019t lose any sleep worrying.\u201d", "They may not have been worrying, but they did lose sleep. According to legend, on the night before the match the Germans chose not to stay in their four-star hotel in Gij\u00f3n, where they had rented out three floors to guarantee peace and security, but in the considerably less salubrious accommodation at their training ground, Sporting Gij\u00f3n\u2019s academy. They found the soundproofing there was as rudimentary as the plumbing, meaning that if anyone flushed a toilet the entire building knew about it, and to make matters worse the security guard\u2019s dog was in the habit of barking all night.", "They certainly appeared to be a bit sleepy as the team that started the tournament as second-favourites were not only bothered by Algeria, but beaten by them. \u201cWe beat them our way,\u201d Belloumi said. \u201cIt was a historic match. In the papers we\u2019d been belittled before the game, but on the pitch we were fighters.\u201d", "Algeria took the lead nine minutes after half-time when after a lovely, incisive move Belloumi\u2019s shot deflected off Schumacher to leave Rabah Madjer \u2013 also famous for scoring in Porto\u2019s 1987 European Cup final win against Bayern Munich, and who has had three spells as Algeria\u2019s manager \u2013 with a straightforward chance that he took expertly. Karl-Heinz Rumenigge equalised in the 67th minute, turning in a low cross from Felix Magath from close range. Nine passes and 23 seconds after the restart Algeria were back in the lead, and this time there was no way back for the Germans.", "\u201cWe felt invincible and we didn\u2019t fear anybody,\u201d Belloumi said. \u201c1982 is the most beautiful memory in the history of Algerian football.

What we achieved, by bringing such joy to the Algerian people, will remain for ever in my memory.\u201d", "Having lost against Austria but beaten Chile in their two remaining group games, Algeria\u2019s players gathered in their hotel to watch the final fixture, between Austria and West Germany, and see whether they would qualify for the second round. Instead they saw two teams colluding to ensure their elimination in", "a display of still-legendary skulduggery", ". Algeria were out, but had made their mark. \u201cWhen I first starting training, I had just seen Belloumi play,\u201d Eric Cantona, 16 that summer, recalled. \u201cIt was a great generation which inspired many people, myself included.\u201d", "Belloumi remains one of the greatest African footballers, a player of sublime skill and ingenuity \u2013 he claims to have invented the blind pass in the 1970s \u2013 who having never played in another World Cup or club football in Europe is rarely mentioned by those compiling all-time-best listicles. Instead there was late-career infamy after a fight in a hotel between Egypt and Algeria players in 1989 ended with the Egyptian doctor being hit in the face with a glass bottle and blinded in one eye. Belloumi was blamed, and an international arrest warrant against him was only dropped 20 years later (he says he was upstairs with the team\u2019s then manager, Abdelhamid Kermali, when the fight happened).", "By then he had been denied again the move to Europe that might have redefined him. In March 1985 he played so well in a friendly between Algeria and Juventus that the Italian side decided to sign him. The Libyan team al-Ittihad put paid to that in May when in the first round of the African Champions League \u2013 and with Belloumi\u2019s side, Mascara, 4-0 ahead after the first leg in Algeria \u2013 they repeatedly fouled him, eventually breaking his leg. Belloumi believes it was targeted. \u201cThey knew they were out so they took revenge on me because I was the star of the team,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just pure, deliberate aggression.\u201d", "The player insists he looks back with no regrets. \u201cI was happy in my own country. I had no reason to leave. You must understand, there was nothing that I couldn\u2019t get in Algeria. I was extremely popular and seeing so many people come to the stadium to watch me was a source of satisfaction and joy.\u201d As, for millions in Algeria and around the world, was the brilliance with which this team of minnows once destroyed the lazy superiority of one of the giants of the international game."]},

I did the same with Ruud van Nistelrooy when", "I was national coach", ". Maybe I was too strong, too hard, too direct like Johan had been with me. I should have been a bit softer with Van Nistelrooy. I now have a very good relationship with Ruud.

Then his opinion was different to how I saw things at Ajax. It was painful but that happens sometimes with a teacher and his pupil. He went right and I went left. All of a sudden we didn\u2019t have any contact. After he died I saw his wife at a golf tournament in Turin.

But losing as a manager was so painful I couldn\u2019t live with it. As a manager you have to be positive to your guys, as a father to his sons, and that was one thing I really didn\u2019t have.", "\u201cThe profession is also bad for your health. When I became the assistant, I was intelligent and helpful. I had patience. As the head coach I was completely the opposite. I made a good decision to get out. I\u2019m now doing other things and feel much freer. I do some business and work for television, talking about football. I still have a nice wife, nice children, two grandchildren. We\u2019re all healthy. So I\u2019m enjoying life.\u201d", "The 56-year-old smiles when I ask about his ankle. \u201cI don\u2019t have any pain but I am limited. I can\u2019t play tennis or football.

They moved for a winger instead, signing Brentford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Benrahma on loan with an obligation to buy, and Haller will be under pressure to shine on Saturday.", "Perhaps it will work out and Benrahma, untested at this level, will add another layer of creativity. The Algerian could make his debut against Fulham, who are likely to test West Ham\u2019s ability to seize the initiative against smaller sides, and a less reactive approach could bring the best out of Haller.", "Yet the worry is that West Ham have fallen into an old trap, prioritising flair over substance. Perhaps they are in the same place as Benrahma: in need of Moyes\u2019s pragmatism.

There are, simply, too many of them. 36 penalty kicks have been awarded in the Premier League.

At the end of which one needs-must part of football, a tool to fix a problem, is threatening to overwhelm all the other working parts. The award, dispute, taking and retaking of penalties is the biggest growth area in the elite game. The penalty kick has won. It\u2019s a star \u2013 something that is both tedious in practice and a symptom of more profound textural change elsewhere.", "This is not about the handball law, which is poorly adapted to the new reality and continues to create weird outcomes. These can be fixed. Serie A also had a record 187 penalties last year. But dig down and, as in England, the key driver is stupid fiddly fouls, not the more headline-grabbing stupid fiddly handballs. The issue isn\u2019t VAR either, which will solve itself, and whose future lies in refinement, AI and more competent human handlers. The problem, for now, is penalty dominance, penalty culture, the penalty supremacy. We just need fewer of them.", "It is worth recalling the basic point of a penalty kick. Penalties are a piece of artifice, a quick fix for a glitch in the machine. Penalties are what happens when football runs out of things to say. Not only does a penalty kick have no textural relationship to every other part of football \u2013 one kick at goal, in the middle of all these moving variables \u2013 it often distorts rather than reflects the flow.", "There are good penalties, those that arrive out of the natural justice of a hard-earned attacking overload.

We may remember here the late", "penalty awarded to Manchester United at Paris Saint-Germain", "in March 2019, where a hopeful shot struck a hand while the ball was heading wide of goal.", "Football is a real-time gymnastic art, not a quest for deep refereeing truths", "A penalty kick awarded for a non-crime that affected nothing turned a creditable away goals defeat into a miraculous United win. A false narrative of promise and progress was born. From there came the permanent hiring of a manager who won five of his next 24 games and still looks genuinely surprised to be asked questions about the internal workings of Manchester United FC each time he appears in public.", "More alarming is the way penalty culture is changing the way the game is played. There are matches where trying to draw a trip or strike a hand feels like the simplest route to victory, players whose value has been significantly boosted by cleverly refined penalty winning skills.", "So much attacking play feels stilted and loose. Watch as Player A slaloms his way across the penalty area, Maradona-style, while his opponents Michael-Flatley away from him. Is this authentic? Is a wonder goal really a wonder goal when skilled defenders are reduced to bouncing around with their arms behind their back like a troupe of skinheads dancing to Jimmy Cliff? Some will find this staccato, interventionist style more to their liking. Those who yearn for completeness and perfectibility will see it as progress. Others will see a tepid tyranny of detail.", "My own dislike of video refereeing has always been an emotional, semi-rational thing, based in the idea that football is one of the last remaining free collective experiences, unfiltered through a screen, unmediated by invisible hands. Football is a real-time gymnastic art, not a tech-driven quest for deep refereeing truths.", "What is certain is this is something different, a step-change as the sport adapts to its status as a purely televisual product. My own compromise would be a clearly defined stiffening of the weight of evidence required to award a penalty kick, a higher bar for the ultimate sanction of", "the law", ". Walton\u2019s literal-minded bunker of truth is a powerful voice in this process. For now it has, without warning or discussion, become the defining one."]},

Asked by Gazzetta whether that made him jealous, he dismissed the idea out of hand. \u201cAbsolutely not. Lorenzo is an idol for me. How can I feel envy?\u201d", "Still, that did not stop him from wanting to beat his brother on Sunday. This is Benevento\u2019s second run at the top-flight and they had made an eye-catching start, with two wins from their first three games. Although their last game, against Roma, ended in a 5-2 defeat, the scores had been level as late as the 69th minute.", "Both brothers made the starting lineups, Lorenzo having returned from injury as a substitute in the Europa League on Thursday. Benevento were heavy underdogs against a Napoli side with three wins from the three games they had played. Although Benevento had picked up some good results, they had also conceded 12 times in four games.", "There would be no such deluge this time. Benevento sat deep, looking for chances on the counter. In the 30th minute, they found one \u2013 a pair of quick passes releasing Gianluca Lapadula down the left channel. His first attempt at a centre was intercepted by a sliding Kostas Manolas, but the second found Roberto Insigne ready to drill the ball home on the near corner of the six-yard box.", "All those years after making his Serie A debut alongside Lorenzo, Roberto had scored his first- top-flight goal while playing against his sibling.The conflict of emotions was overwhelming. \u201cIt\u2019s an immense joy to score against Napoli,\u201d he said, acknowledging a sense of vindication at puncturing a team that gave up on him. Still, this was the club he had grown up supporting and \u201cI was sorry to score against my brother.\u201d", "Lorenzo would not let himself be easily outshone. In the 41st minute, he came in from the left and sent a trademark swerving strike towards the far corner from 20 yards out, demanding a full-stretch save from Lorenzo Montip\u00f2. At the start of the second half, he had a goal disallowed for offside.", "He drew another fine stop just before the hour mark, after finding space at a corner. For Benevento, it was only a stay of execution. The ball came straight back to Insigne in an almost identical position. This time he opened up his body to shoot with his notionally weaker left foot. From outside the D, he placed the ball off the underside of the crossbar and in.", "A chance to win the game arrived moments later, Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko lifting a pass over the home defence and on to Lorenzo Insigne\u2019s head, but he could not direct in on target. Instead, Andrea Petagna put Napoli in front, taking a pass from Matteo Politano and forcing the ball homex.", "Atalanta 1-3 Sampdoria, Benevento 1-2 Napoli, Cagliari 4-2 Crotone, Fiorentina 3-2 Udinese, Genoa 0-2 Internazionale, Juventus 1-1 Verona, Lazio 2-1 Bologna, Parma 2-2 Spezia, Sassuolo 3-3 Torino", "There was time yet for a nervy ending. Gennaro Gattuso might have been experiencing flashbacks when he saw Montip\u00f2 run forward for a Benevento free-kick in the eighth minute of added time. His debut as Milan manager three years ago had been against the same opponents, who claimed their first-ever Serie A point with an", "injury", "-time goal scored by their keeper, Alberto Brignoli", ".", "This time, though, Alex Meret tipped the ball over the bar to deny any such drama. This day belonged to Roberto and Lorenzo Insigne \u2013 the second pair of brothers to score in the same Serie A game, after Istvan and Ferenc Nyers, Inter and Lazio in 1949.", "\u201cLorenzo scored a beautiful goal, a tricky one with him being right-footed,\u201d said Roberto. \u201cI am happy we both scored, even if I\u2019m disappointed about the result.\u201d", "What, though, of Antonio, and his claim to being better than either of them? \u201cLet\u2019s let him believe that,\u201d said a laughing Roberto. \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty good footballer too.\u201d"]},

The fans and the media search for a narrative to explain it. It\u2019s the same when a team does well.", "\u201cLast season, for instance, we won the league by 14 points. People were saying we were doing fantastically well. But when you looked at the underlying data, we didn\u2019t actually improve. Our closest competitors got worse.

A counterthrust from Guardiola radically altered the dynamic. As the players trotted off at half-time, the score already 1-1, there was a sense of some perfect little miniature being played out.", "It couldn\u2019t last.

Both teams were left drowning in lactic acid from around the hour mark, although City had the craft to dominate the ball from that point.", "And secondly there was \u2013 of course \u2013 another unworthy moment of intervention from the video referee.

Stick to your own strengths, turn up the volume, repeat until successful.", "Just as Guardiola has packed his best teams with technical midfielders, making a fetish of pass and move, Klopp did something similar here, doubling down on hard-running inside forwards and turning the whole world a shade of red-shirted high press.", "How many is too many anyway? At times, with the full-backs high, Liverpool had six attacking players arriving at improbable angles. Three times in the opening four minutes Jota or Salah spun into a huge pocket of space, blue shirts revolving around them giddily.", "It was from the left that the opening goal came as Andrew Robertson fed Sadio Man\u00e9. His sideways spring was too slick for Kyle Walker, who went veering past like a bin lorry on an icy incline. A nudge to the hip sent Man\u00e9 spinning. Salah buried the kick.", "City were being smothered. De Bruyne completed just eight passes in the opening quarter of the game. The hounding of Rodri continued. And yet there was always a lurking sense of weakness. The 11-man duvet is never quite big enough. Every overload leaves a weakness somewhere else. Behind Liverpool\u2019s heavy cavalry there would naturally be space.", "Every Liverpool overload leaves a weakness somewhere else. Guardiola shifted his team to find it", "Guardiola shifted his team to find it. It was thrilling to watch, a real-time display of in-game tactical chess as City pressed their back four a little higher and went wider with the ball from the back. Further forward De Bruyne pulled into the space on the right Liverpool had often vacated and began to take the ball with room to turn.", "The game changed instantly. First De Bruyne\u2019s cross almost found Raheem Sterling in front of goal. Moments later City slipped past the press again. Walker made good ground. De Bruyne played ball inside to Gabriel Jesus, who turned ingeniously and finished with real skill.", "Those were Jesus\u2019s seventh and eighth touches of the game. Ten minutes into the second half he had a chance to put City ahead, reading Jo\u00e3o Cancelo\u2019s pass, making the right run, but heading wide.", "It was hard not to feel sympathy. Sergio Ag\u00fcero also misses chances. And while Jesus may not be an eye-catching Brazilian striker, he is a hugely intelligent one. The goal was his eighth in 11 games as City\u2019s lone centre forward.", "A 1-1 draw left both managers satisfied, neither happy. It will be fascinating to see how Klopp chooses to deploy the power of his four-man forward line, and how he manages the counterpoint, its brittleness against high quality opponents.

He was involved in the move in the 77th minute that led to Neves arrowing a shot towards the top corner from the edge of the box. Schmeichel flung himself to his left to swat it away with one outstretched hand.", "Rodgers then replaced Praet with Wes Morgan, a defender, so that Leicester could hold on.

The City attack broke down, and Liverpool went again to launch a counterattack. Sterling, trying to regain possession, fouled Jo\u00ebl Matip and earned a booking. Just behind him, Alexander-Arnold pulled up and sank to the pitch", "with a calf injury", ". Human bodies, even those of athletes, are fragile. Pulls and strains and tweaks happen. But in context, it was hard not to see Alexander-Arnold as the victim of the remorselessness of Covid football\u2019s schedule.", "Alexander-Arnold, who will now be missing for up to four weeks, has already played 1,137 minutes since his season began with a substitute appearance for England in the Nations League game in Iceland in September.", "That is a little more than 12-and-a-half full games in two months \u2013 and despite being used relatively sparingly by Gareth Southgate and being taken off early in two games by J\u00fcrgen Klopp, even before the injury on Sunday. He is one of 26 Premier League players currently sidelined by the sort of soft tissue injuries that are characteristic of fatigue.", "You don\u2019t have to be the Dutch fitness guru Raymond Verheijen to diagnose a problem \u2013 and that is before another international break in which three games will be squeezed into the space that used to be allocated for two. England v Republic of Ireland friendlies rarely generate much sense of anticipation, but none surely has ever been approached in quite such a mood of bored resentment as this.", "Injuries are not the only issue. The game is suffering as well. City v Liverpool began spectacularly. The first half was brilliant. Klopp\u2019s unexpected switch to a front four unsettled City and the game was thrillingly stretched. City then worked out a way of countering that and hit back in the second part of the first half.", "The term \u201cintriguing tactical battle\u201d is often a euphemism for lacking in incident, but not here: there was attack after attack, chance after chance, the game played at an astonishing pace.", "City perhaps had the edge after half-time, and the central defensive pairing of R\u00faben Dias and Aymeric Laporte gave them a solidity they have not had in a season and a half. But then, just as the game should have been building to its great climax, nothing. There were 16 shots in the first hour of the game, one in the final half hour.", "Perhaps there was an element of both sides settling for what they had \u2013 although City had talked bullishly before the game of the need to close the gap \u2013 but, equally, everybody was blatantly knackered. It is true, it had been a particularly energetic first half, and it\u2019s also true that consistent rain had probably made the pitch as heavy as modern pitches ever get, but, still, this isn\u2019t how the Premier League is supposed to be.", "There are multiple causes, and numerous steps that could have been taken to mitigate the demands of the schedule. That they have not been highlights football\u2019s general lack of leadership and the way greed so dominates the thinking that nobody can see beyond their own self-interest.", "Klopp and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r both highlighted the problems of teams competing in Europe and then playing the early match three days later, as Manchester United and Tottenham had to last weekend. And that does seem a simple matter to resolve, except that BT Sport has the 12.30pm TV slot on a Saturday. This weekend, given City v Liverpool was scheduled as Sky\u2019s first pick for Sunday afternoon, and with three sides in Europa League action, that meant the best game available to it, had it ignored sides who had played in the Champions League last Wednesday, was probably either Crystal Palace v Leeds or Southampton v Newcastle. Enticing as both of those games may have been in the immediate context, it is understandable BT should go for the larger audience of a Manchester United game. Still, it is hard to believe compromise can\u2019t be found.", "Similarly, Klopp and Pep Guardiola both complained that the Premier League permits only three substitutions rather than the five allowed in the majority of European leagues this season, a proposal", "rejected by the majority of Premier League clubs", ". And while that may look petty as dozens of premium hamstrings twang across the league over Christmas, can they really be blamed, when the playing field is so slanted anyway, for resisting yet another measure that would advantage the elite?", "Then there is the question of why all these games are being played at all. Why is football essentially pretending the 100-day Covid break did not happen? Might teams involved in Europe have been excused the League Cup this season? Do we really need this edition of the Nations League? We certainly don\u2019t need the inevitable tedium of an England v Ireland friendly. And that\u2019s before you get to more creative solutions such as running the Premier League on a group system this season, to reduce the number of fixtures.", "It is all money, of course. The Nations League has to go ahead because Uefa\u2019s smaller confederations need the revenue it generates. Similarly clubs need the League Cup and as many league matches as possible. But it is hard not to avoid the thought that if football\u2019s financial structures were fairer, if the greed of the elite hadn\u2019t jeopardised the very existence of the non-elite, this endless churn of exhausted football might not be necessary. And the victims in it all are the soft tissues of the players."]},

The union \u2013 which represents more than 60,000 players worldwide \u2013 released a statement on Friday which said the current fixture pile-up lacks sufficient considerations for their \u201chealth, wellbeing and performance and requires an urgent and ongoing revision by competition organisers\u201d.", "\u201cIt was peculiar that the Premier League did not allow five substitutions,\u201d Vincent Gouttebarge, Fifpro\u2019s chief medical officer, told the Guardian. \u201cBy contrast, it is allowed in all the other major leagues in Europe and in the Champions League and Europa League, and it is obviously one of our recommendations. It would be nice to have the same everywhere because it provides the manager with an opportunity to rest some of his players and perhaps manage workload better. The Premier League is one of the most affected because it is the top league in the world and it attracts elite players who are also playing international football.\u201d", "A study commissioned by Fifpro after the 2018 World Cup in Russia found that 64% of the elite professional players believed they have insufficient rest between matches, with Premier League teams estimated to lose on average \u00a345m due to injury-related reduction in performance per season as a result.", "As well as the mandatory implementation of the five substitutes rule, they have also recommended that players are given a minimum of four weeks holiday for their off-season break and a flexible two-week in-season break, as well as committed to developing an online monitoring tool to track player workload and the impact of travel and injuries.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been two years since our survey and we have been repeating this message all the time,\u201d said Gouttebarge. \u201cThe problem is escalating all the time. Fifa has also implemented an international window at the end of January and the start of February when there is normally only domestic football and it is going to be important that the players are given sufficient time to recover.\u201d", "He added: \u201cI\u2019m sure the people who are in lockdown at home are very happy to see European matches on Tuesday to Thursday and then they can watch their domestic competition from Friday to Monday. We have been engaged in such a cycle since approximately the start of September without any midweek breaks. It\u2019s all about cumulative load \u2013 every player can play three matches in eight days but it\u2019s very difficult when you are doing it without a break, as well as the physical and mental strain of competing and performing.\u201d"]}
